    "\"Principal Component Analysis identified five key health clusters: age-related metabolic indicators (AGE, HbA1c, BMI), kidney function markers (Cr, Urea), cardiovascular lipid profiles (Cholesterol, LDL), lipid transport (VLDL), and protective cardiovascular indicators (HDL).\" Among these indicators founded above, ours Playground competition has Age, BMI, Cholesterol (total), LDL (low density) and HDL (high density). Unfortunately, data doesn't have HbA1c (glycated hemoglobin), used to measure an individual's glucose control levels, which is the paramount factor in predicting diabetes mellitus."

    "Preliminary analysis shows that there is some covariate shift between train and test, but the OOF is basically reliable. There is a gap between CV and LB, but I think this is a normal occurrence and not necessarily a signal of overfitting. Moreover, in this competition, the public LB only comprises 20% of the data.\n",
    "The difference between the orig dataset and the competition dataset is relatively larger, so directly concatenating the orig data is not feasible in this competition. However, I do not think this implies that the orig dataset is useless."
